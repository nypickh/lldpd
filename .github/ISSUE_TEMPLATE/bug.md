This is an example of bug report. Read it to the bottom and Try to
adapt it to your case. Please, do not use this template for
configuration problems, getting help on how to compile, cross-compile
on some platforms. Keep in mind that *lldpd* has been deployed
successfully on hundred of thousands of devices and therefore it is
unlikely it just does not work. Instead, use the
[discussions](https://github.com/lldpd/lldpd/discussions) for support
questions.

When putting code snippets (logs, commands), put them between triple
backticks:

```
# lldpcli -vv
[output of lldpcli -vv]
```

# Bug description

## Steps to reproduce the problem

 1. Compile `lldpd` with `./configure --localstatedir=/var --with-snmp && make`.

 2. Install with `sudo make install`.

 3. Run `lldpd`.

 4. Wait for a LLDPDU from the remote switch (vendor Pisco, release 19.1(478)KHT47.3).

## Expected outcome

`lldpd` should accept the LLDPDU and it should be available in the
output of `lldpcli show neighbors details`.

## Current outcome

After executing the above steps, `lldpd` crashed. Here is the end of
the output of `lldpd -ddddd` before the crash:

```
2016-11-10T11:06:40 [ DBG/lldp] receive LLDP PDU on eno1
2016-11-10T11:06:40 [ DBG/alloc] allocate a new management address (family: 1)

2016-11-10T11:06:40 [ DBG/decode] MSAP is unknown, search for the chassis
2016-11-10T11:06:40 [ DBG/decode] unknown chassis, add it to the list
```
